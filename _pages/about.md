My name is Xin Tong (Chinese: 仝鑫). I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://mede.caltech.edu/">Medical Engineering (MedE)</a> and <a href="https://www.ee.caltech.edu/">Electrical Engineering (EE)</a> at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology (Caltech)</a>. My Ph.D. advisor is Prof. Lihong V. Wang.

My research focuses on advancing biomedical imaging through two directions. In <b>photoacoustic imaging</b>, I designed and engineered state-of-the-art photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) systems that non-invasively visualize deep vascular structures with high speed and resolution. I also applied computational, statistical, and machine learning techniques to enhance image quality and enable intelligent diagnosis of diseases such as breast cancer and cardiovascular conditions. In <b>quantum imaging</b>, I pioneered optical imaging systems that leverage spatial and polarization-entangled photon pairs to surpass classical limits. My work addresses key challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratios and limited resolvable pixel counts in quantum imaging, enabling practical quantum-enhanced imaging for whole organisms and cellular structures. My long-term goal is to explore and push the clinical translation of novel imaging modalities by integrating them with frontier computational methods.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring visual art and music. I am also a huge fan of travel photography, hiking, and skiing. My photography portfolio can be found <a href="https://xintong-barry.github.io/photography/">here</a>.
