My name is Xin Tong (Chinese: 仝鑫). I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://mede.caltech.edu/">Medical Engineering (MedE)</a> and <a href="https://www.ee.caltech.edu/">Electrical Engineering (EE)</a> at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology (Caltech)</a>.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
